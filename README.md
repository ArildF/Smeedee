# Smeedee

## Project Description

Smeedee is a monitor that harvests key information from running software projects. Smeedee finds useful information in the Version Control System (source control), Continuous Integration system (build servers), source code itself and in the project management tool you are using. The key information is interpreted and then visualized on a digital Dashboard. 

So instead of working in an information centric environment, were you have to find and interpret the data yourself. Smeedee will find and interpret the data for you, and then push key information to you and the rest of the team.

With Smeedee, you’ll experience a better flow of information in your team. The teamwork will become more transparent and you’ll have a superior tool for maximizing productivity and quality in software projects.

### Features:

* Smeedee can tell you who has changed to the source code lately, and what they have done
* Smeedee can tell you when a build is broken
* Smeedee can tell you who is the most active member on your team
* Smeedee can tell you how many working days you have left before the next release
* Smeedee can tell you about the overall activity in the project
* Smeedee can tell you about the performance of your team (sprint Burndown)
